# Project Descriptions
- ChallengeHub is a solo project that showcases my skills in building full-stack web applications. It allows users to create challenges and share them with friends, who can then add shared goals and compete to complete the most. Each goal has a specific number of points assigned by the challenge creator, making the experience engaging and competitive. The backend was developed using Django REST Framework, while the frontend was built with React.

- Main pages: 
 - homepage, display some analysis of user performance
 - challenges page, displays all the challenges as cards, seperated by activity
 - challenge detail, has the details of a single challenge and displays all its goals, and the rank of participants.
